requires:
  alertmanager:

  s3:
    interface: s3
    limit: 1
    description: |
      The coordinator obtains and shares storage details with workers, enabling Mimir's access to an S3 bucket for data storage.

  logging-consumer:
    interface: loki_push_api
    description: |
      Forward workers' built-in logging rules to the external Loki
      (the coordinator, not the worker, owns all rule files).
      Obtain rules and Loki's API endpoint to later send them to the loki ruler over another
      relation.

  ingress:
    interface: ingress
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Ingress-per-app, to load-balance across multiple units of the coordinator.

  certificates:
    interface: tls-certificates
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Certificate and key files for securing Mimir communications with TLS.

  tracing:
    interface: tracing
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Enables sending traces to the tracing backend.

provides:
  loki-cluster:
    interface: loki_cluster
    description: |
      The coordinator sends the Mimir configuration to the workers, obtaining
      the roles they are configured to take on and their addressing information.

  receive-remote-write:
    interface: prometheus_remote_write

  grafana-dashboards-provider:
    interface: grafana_dashboard
    description: |
      Forward workers' built-in dashboards to grafana
      (the coordinator, not the worker, owns all dashboards).

  grafana-source:
    interface: grafana_datasource

  self-metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
    description: |
      The coordinator provides scrape jobs for itself and for the workers.

config:
  options:
    ingestion-rate-mb:
      description: |
        Per-user ingestion rate limit (MB/s).
        This config option matches exactly Loki's `ingestion_rate_mb`, except that it is an integer here
        (Loki takes a float).
        This same value is used internally for setting `per_stream_rate_limit`. Loki uses a default of 3 for
        `ingestion_rate_mb`, but 4 for `per_stream_rate_limit`. For this reason we use 4 as the default here.

        Ref: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#limits_config
      type: int
      default: 4
    ingestion-burst-size-mb:
      description: |
        This config option matches exactly Loki's `ingestion_burst_size_mb`, except that it is an integer here
        (Loki takes a float).
        This same value is used internally for setting `per_stream_rate_limit_burst`. Loki uses a default of 6 for
        `ingestion_burst_size_mb`, but 15 for `per_stream_rate_limit_burst`. For this reason we use 15 as the default
        here.

        Ref: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#limits_config
      type: int
      default: 15
    retention-period:
      description: |
        Sets a global retention period for log streams in Loki. A value of 0 disables retention (default).
        Minimum retention period is 1d.
        Specify the period in days. For example, to set a 48-day retention period, use `48`.
        Specifying retention periods for individual streams is not currently supported.
      type: int
      default: 0
