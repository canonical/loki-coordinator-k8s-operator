    description: |
      Integration to receive metrics from other charms to a 
      Prometheus-remote-write-compatible endpoint.
  grafana-dashboards-provider:
    interface: grafana_dashboard
    optional: true
    description: |
      Forward workers' built-in dashboards to grafana
      (the coordinator, not the worker, owns all dashboards).
  grafana-source:

    optional: true
  self-metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
    optional: true

    description: |
      Forward workers' built-in logging rules to the external Loki
      (the coordinator, not the worker, owns all rule files).
      Obtain rules and Loki's API endpoint to later send them to the loki ruler over another
      relation.
  ingress:

config:
  options:
    ingestion-rate-mb:
      description: |
        Per-user ingestion rate limit (MB/s).
        This config option matches exactly Loki's `ingestion_rate_mb`, except that it is an integer here
        (Loki takes a float).
        This same value is used internally for setting `per_stream_rate_limit`. Loki uses a default of 3 for
        `ingestion_rate_mb`, but 4 for `per_stream_rate_limit`. For this reason we use 4 as the default here.

        Ref: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#limits_config
      type: int
      default: 4
    ingestion-burst-size-mb:
      description: |
        This config option matches exactly Loki's `ingestion_burst_size_mb`, except that it is an integer here
        (Loki takes a float).
        This same value is used internally for setting `per_stream_rate_limit_burst`. Loki uses a default of 6 for
        `ingestion_burst_size_mb`, but 15 for `per_stream_rate_limit_burst`. For this reason we use 15 as the default
        here.

        Ref: https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configure/#limits_config
      type: int
      default: 15
    retention-period:
      description: |
        Sets a global retention period for log streams in Loki. A value of 0 disables retention (default).
        Minimum retention period is 1d.
        Specify the period in days. For example, to set a 48-day retention period, use `48`.
        Specifying retention periods for individual streams is not currently supported.
      type: int
      default: 0
    reporting_enabled:
      description: |
        Toggle anonymous reporting of usage info to Grafana.
